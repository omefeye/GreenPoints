# 🌱 GreenPoints

Tokenized Eco Rewards System

GreenPoints is a blockchain-based eco reward system where users are incentivized to make environmentally sustainable choices through tokenized rewards. This project operates on the Stellar network using smart contracts developed with Soroban and its native token, GreenPoints Token (GP). Users can earn GP by making eco-friendly decisions both in virtual shopping experiences and through real-life activities such as cycling, walking, and using public transport.
